[![Build Status](https://jenkins.ci.cloudbees.com/buildStatus/icon?job=plugins/hashicorp-vault-plugin&build=20)](https://jenkins.ci.cloudbees.com/job/plugins/hashicorp-vault-plugin/20/)
# Jenkins Vault Plugin

This plugin adds a build wrapper to set environment variables from a HashiCorp [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) secret. Secrets are generally masked in the build log, so you can't accidentally print them.

# Vault Authentication Backends
This plugin only allows authenticating against Vault using the AppRole authentication backend. Hashicorp recommends using AppRole for Servers / automated workflows (like Jenkins) and using Tokens (default mechanism, Github Token, ...) for every developer's machine.  

### How does AppRole work?
In short: you register an approle auth backend using a self-chosen name (e.g. Jenkins). This approle is identified by a `role-id` and secured with a `secret_id`. If you have both of those values you can ask Vault for a token that can be used to access vault.  
When registering the approle backend you can set a couple of different parameters: 
* How long should the `secret_id` live (can be indefinite)
* how often can one use a token that is obtained via this backend
* which IP addresses can obtain a token using `role-id` and `secret-id`?
* many more  

This is just a short introduction, please refer to [Hashicorp itself](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/approle.html) to get detailed information.
### Why no other backends? 
Because we believe that all other backends are built for humans, not for machines. We should avoid the concept of a "technical user" at all times. There are not technical users, there are just machines and AppRole is exactly what we need here.  
The only backend that may make sense is the AWS EC2 backend, but we do not support it yet.
If you feel the urge to use token authentication, you should use version 1.3.


# Plugin Usage
### Configuration
You can configure the plugin on three different levels:
* Global: in your global config
* [Folder](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Folders+Plugin)-Level: in folder your job is running in
* Job-Level: either on your freestyle project job or directly in the Jenkinsfile 

The lower the level the higher its priority, meaning: if you configure a URL in your global settings, but override it in your particular job, this URL will be used for communicating with Vault.
In your configuration (may it be global, folder or job) you see the following screen: 
![Global Configuration](docs/images/configuration_screen.png)

The credential you need to provide is a `VaultTokenCredential`, which looks like this:  

![Credential Configuration](docs/images/credential_screen.png)

Obviously you enter your `role-id` and `secret-id` there. The description helps to find your credential later, the id is not mandatory (a UUID is generated by default), but it helps to set it if you want to use your credential inside the Jenkinsfile.

### Usage in FreeStyle Jobs
If you still use free style jobs (hint: you should consider migrating to [Jenkinsfile](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/)), you can configure both configuration and the secrets you need on the job level.

![Job Configuration](docs/images/job_screen.png)

The secrets are available as environment variables then. 

### Usage via Jenkinsfile
Let the code speak for itself:
```groovy
node {
  // define the secrets and the env variables
  def secrets = [
      [$class: 'VaultSecret', path: 'secret/testing', secretValues: [
          [$class: 'VaultSecretValue', envVar: 'testing', vaultKey: 'value_one'],
          [$class: 'VaultSecretValue', envVar: 'testing_again', vaultKey: 'value_two']]],
      [$class: 'VaultSecret', path: 'secret/another_test', secretValues: [
          [$class: 'VaultSecretValue', envVar: 'another_test', vaultKey: 'value']]]
  ]
  
  // optional configuration, if you do not provide this the next higher configuration
  // (e.g. folder or global) will be used
  def configuration = [$class: 'VaultConfiguration', 
                       vaultUrl: 'http://my-very-other-vault-url.com', 
                       vaultTokenCredentialId: 'my-vault-cred-id']
  
  // inside this block your credentials will be available as env variables
  wrap([$class: 'VaultBuildWrapper', configuration: configuration, vaultSecrets: secrets]) {
      sh 'echo $testing'
      sh 'echo $testing_again'
      sh 'echo $another_test'
  }
}
```
In the future we might migrate to a [BuildStep](http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/tasks/BuildStep.html) instead of a BuildWrapper.

# Migration Guide
### Upgrade from 1.x to 2.0
The `BuildWrapper` did not change, so no changes to your Jenkinsfile should be necessary. However, you need to reconfigure Vault in your Jenkins instance based on the instructions above. There is no way to smoothly upgrade this, because this is a) a major rewrite and b) we do not support the token backend anymore.
